This repository is used to host the URL lists and resources used by ooni-probe
and measurement-kit and to handle the update of them.

The new location for Tor bridge test targets is the `ooni/sysadmin` repo file: https://github.com/ooni/sysadmin/blob/master/ansible/roles/probe-services/templates/tor_targets.json

## Contribution notes

When suggesting changes do not edit things inside of `assets/` as those are
automatically generated from https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists or
`bridge_reachability/*`.

## Maintainer usage

If this is the first time you are running this you may have to initialize your
working_dir and the remote repository.

This can be done with:

```
python run.py initialize
```

Every time you need to check for updates of the resources you should run:

```
python run.py update
```
